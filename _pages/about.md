Hi! I'm a first-year Computer Science PhD Student at Dartmouth College working with Professor Adam Breuer. I am interested in machine learning theory, data privacy, and natural language processing. I completed my undergrad in May 2024 from Stony Brook University in Mathematics.

At Stony Brook, I researched human-aware autoencoding LLMs under Professor H. Andrew Schwartz, with mentorship from Adithya V. Ganesan and Nikita Soni.

In summer 2023, under Professor Neil Heffernan and PhD student Morgan Lee at Worcester Polytechnic Institue (WPI), I trained a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model to predict student mastery of class content for use in the ASSISTments educational technology platform. In summer 2022, I researched in algorithmic fairness at WPI under Professor Elke Rundensteiner and PhD student Kathleen Cachel.

Outside of research, I have a passion for math education and environmentalism. For the past two years at Stony Brook, I was a Lead Tutor at the Academic Success and Tutoring Center, where I helped mentor newer tutors, and I was Treasurer for the Stony Brook Environmental Club.

In my free time, I enjoy chess, Scrabble, tennis, piano, funk music, and rock climbing.
